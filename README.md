## Overview

In this lab, you'll get practice working with protocols. 


## Bank Vault

![](http://i.imgur.com/TXSJip9.jpg?1)

Locate the `BankVault.swift` file. Created for you is the `BankVault` class:

```swift
class BankVault {
    
    let name: String
    let address: String
    var amount: Double = 0.0
    
    init(name: String, address: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.address = address
    }
    
}
```

It has three instance properties. `name` which is a constant of type `String`, `address` is a constant of type `String` and `amount` which is a variable of type `Double` set to a default value of 0.0.

It also has an initializer which takes in two arguments, both of type `String` which assigns those passed values to the `name` and `address` properties. 

**(1)** - In the `BankVault.swift` file, create a protocol named `ProvideAccess`. This protocol should require any class/struct that conforms to it to implement a function called `allowEntryWithPassword` which takes in one argument called password of type `[Int]` (an array of `Int`s). The function should return a `Bool`.

**(2)** - In the `BankVault.swift` file, below where you created the `ProvideAccess` protocol - create an extension on the `BankVault` class. In that extension, it should conform to the `ProvideAccess` protocol. In your implementation of the `allowEntryWithPassword(_:)` function, you should adhere to the following rules:

* If the person calling on this function doesn't enter in any digits (empty array), then we should return `false`.
* If the total numbers of digits entered (items in the array) exceed 10, then we should return `false`.
* In order to allow access (return `true`), every other digit (starting with the first digit) must be even. The first digit entered is the first element in the array.

There are tests in the `BankVaultTests.swift` file. Press `command` + `u` to run these tests to make sure you implemented the `allowEntryWithPassword(_:)` function correctly.

## Ships

Created for you is a file, `Ships.swift` - but it's empty. We're going to create various classes in this file, but in a slightly different way. 

[Protocol-Oriented Programming in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/408/) - I suggest watching this video (not right now), but it's something you should definitely bookmark and watch sometime in the future. It's advanced so it might be a little difficult to watch at this point in your programming career.

You're going to create various classes with a Protocol-Oriented Programming approach.

**(1)** - In the `Ships.swift` file, create an enum called `Direction` that has four cases. `north`, `south`, `east` and `west`.

**(2)** - Below the `Direction` enum, create a new protocol called `SteerAbility`. This protocol should require any class/struct conforming to it to provide a property called `direction` of type `Direction` that is both gettable and settable. It should also require that the class/struct conforming to it should provide a function called `steerInDirection(_:)`. This function should take in an argument called `direction` which is of type `Direction`. Mark this function as mutating, because in its implementation (which will we will do soon), it will change the value of one of its properties and because it's doing that we need to mark it as mutating. This only affects structs and not classes, but we don't know who will be implementing this protocol, it could be both structs & classes so we are required to mark it as mutating no matter what.

**(3)** - Below this newly made Protocol - create an extension on the `SteerAbility` protocol.

Like this:

```swift
extension SteerAbility {
    
    
}
```

We've just extended a protocol.

In that extension (within the curly braces). Create a mutating function (the EXACT one you're asking classes or structs to implement if they were to conform to the `SteerAbility` protocol.) This function should be called `steerInDirection(_:)`. It should have one argument called `direction` of type `Direction`. It should also be marked as a mutating. You're going to now implement this function. In its implementation, you should set the `direction` property to equal the `direction` argument to this function.


```swift
self.direction = direction
```

The reason you have to write `self.direction` is because the argument label matches the name of the instance property.


**(4)** - Still in the `Ships.swift` file, below where you just created the extension on `SteerAbility`, create a new class called `SailBoat` which conforms to the `SteerAbility` protocol. In conforming to this protocol, you might think that you need to provide both the `direction` instance property and the `steerInDirection(_:)` function but you're only required to provide the `direction` property because the `steerInDirection(_:)` has a _default_ implementation. The implementation of the `steerInDirection(_:)` function you provided above within the extension has given us this _default_ implementation.

So provide only an instance property called `direction` of type `Direction` with a default value of `.north`. Since all properties (only one in this case) are set to an actual value, you aren't required to provide an initializer.

**(5)** - Below the `SailBoat` class, create a class called `RowBoat` which also conforms to the `SteerAbility` protocol. Just like in the above instruction, only provide a `direction` property with a default value of `.north`. 

**(6)** - Create a class called `SteamBoat` that also conforms to the `SteerAbility` protocol. Just like above, you should only provide a `direction` property with a default value of `.north`. You should not implement the `steerInDirection(_:)` as this already has a default implementation.

There is a file called `ShipTests.swift` which will make sure you implemented everything correctly. Press command + u to run your tests.
